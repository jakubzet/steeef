# steeef
A customized version of the [steeef theme](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/steeef.zsh-theme) for zsh.

#### How is this different to the original?
- Added left-hand side decoration
- Added NodeJS (via NVM or system) version number indicator
- Added time on the right-hand side
- Removed custom configuration, so default terminal theming is inherited

### Installation
1. Download the file with .zsh-theme extension and place it in your zsh theme directory.
2. Edit your config to point to steef theme.
3. Restart your terminal.
